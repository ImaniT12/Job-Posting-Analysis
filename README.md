# Fraudulent Job Detection
By: Imani Thompson
# Overview
This project analyses which job opening features Indeed should consider when determining whether or not they have a fraudulent job listed. Descriptive analysis of job posting predictions shows that job descriptions and job requirements together have a higher potential of identifying fraudulent activity. This was determine by the final model which had a 97% accuracy score. Natural language processing techniques were used on this binary classification model. Indeed can use these findings to get rid of fraudulent jobs on their website or give vistor direct access to my website created to predict the status.

# Business Understanding
My Stakeholder is Indeed, a worldwide employmeny website, that has thousands of job postings. An issue that they are encountering is the amount of fraudulent job postings. I was hired by this company to create a model to determine the amount of fraudulent job postings on their website. My predictions are important from a business prospective because I will be analysing actual data to get my answer and not just taking educated guesses. Determining whether or not a job opening is fruadulent is considered a binary classification, therefore it will require a binary classification model. Since job postings consist of a good bit of text I will be using natural language processing to model with text. Indeed would like a strong model that increases the amount of true negatives and have little to no false positives and false negative. A false positive in this context would be my model predicting that a job opening is not fraudlent and it being correct. A true negative in this context would be my model predicting a job opening is fraudulent and it being incorrect. A false negative in this context would be my model predictign a job opening is not fraudulent but it is. Both false positive and negative are bad but which is worst just depends on the situation. I am focused on optimising the accuracy score when modeling.
# Data Understanding
The data I used for my analyse is from kaggle. This dataset was made in 2020 and it consist of 18,000 rows which are individual job postings. This dataset has both textual information and meta-information about the jobs. Overall this dataset is related to the data analysis questions because it holds all the necessary information to determine what job postings are legit. The target varible within this dataset is the fraudlent column. Other variables included in this dataset are job job title, location, department, salary range, benefits, etc. The varibles that I will focus on are the descriptions and requirements. These two variables are objects and include missing values.
# Methods
Since my main focus concerning this datatset is the job description and requiremnts, I am going to ignore all other columns. The columns decription and requirements have missing values so I dropped all of them. I also made a new column called words that is a combination of both description and requirements.
# Modeling
# Conclusion
I would recommend that Indeed focus on looking more into both the description and requirements together for a higher chance of determining whether it is fraudulent or not. I would also recommend them to give their viewers direct access to my website that I created to make predictions based on both description and requirements. If a viewer is feeling suspicous about a job all they have to do it click a link that takes them directly to my website and paste in their text. A reason why my model has a possibility of not solving the problem everytime is because it is only 97% accurate which leaves 3% of the time being inaccurate. Future plans that I could improve is cleaning the text more, this process is never ending and adjustments can always be made. I would also like to increase true positives, which in this case is if the model predict an opening is fraulent and it is correct.
